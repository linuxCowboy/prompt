# prompt
bash prompt with _exit status_ and _git branch_

![Screenshot](screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

I want my bash prompt to include:
 - history number (apply with !number)
 - number of background jobs
 - hostname
 - working directory
 - exit status of last command (only if != 0: Rule of Silence)
 - git branch (only if in git tree)
 - git dirty status (I:index M:modified U:untracked)
